# EV Charging Station Simulation

Simulates EV charging station usage over one year to calculate power demand and energy consumption.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
1. Run a simulation for 20 chargepoints
2. Display total energy consumed, theoretical/actual maximum power demand, and concurrency factor
3. Run analysis showing concurrency factors for 1-30 chargepoints
